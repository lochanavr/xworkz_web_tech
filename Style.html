            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;  ">Software development is the process used to create software. Programming and maintaining the source code is the central step of this process, but it also includes conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, software design, testing, to release. Software engineering, in addition to development, also includes project management, employee management, and other overhead functions.[1] Software development may be sequential, in which each step is complete before the next begins, but iterative development methods where multiple steps can be executed at once and earlier steps can be revisited have also been devised to improve flexibility, efficiency, and scheduling.</p>

                <dd style="color: blue;">Each of the available methodologies are<b> best suited to specific kinds of projects</b>, based on various technical, organizational, project, and team considerations.[3]
                     The simplest methodology <i>is the "code and fix", typically used </i>by a single programmer working on a small project. <mark>After briefly considering the purpose of the program,</mark> the programmer codes it and runs it to see if it works. When they are done, the product is released. This methodology is useful for prototypes but cannot be used for more elaborate programs.[4]
                    In the top-down waterfall model, feasibility, analysis, design, development, quality assurance, and implementation occur sequentially in that order. This model requires one step to be complete before the next begins, causing delays, and makes it impossible to revise previous steps if necessary.[5][6][7]</dd>
